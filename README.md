# Cellular Automata GUI

This is an implementation of different [cellular automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) in Matlab (written and tested in Matlab 2017b). 
- [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Majority Game
- Copy Cat
- Infection
- Wolframs 2D Cellular Automata

To start the program, clone this repository, open matlab and run `MAIN.m`. I hope you enjoy playing around with the parameters. there is a description of what each parameter is doing in the GUI. For any feedback you can open an issue or send me an email to `dcts.coding@gmail.com`.
